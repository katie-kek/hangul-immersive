# LanguageImmersionPrj

This is an ongoing project focusing on language immersion through gaming. 
Initially beginning in languages like Korean or Chinese (Traditional), the project will focus on answering questions and speaking to non-player characters that use AI for practicing. When prompted,
the player answers questions that will help build vocabulary through repetition and visualizing the words. 
This project (coming in May/June 2024) will be a demo or a walkthrough of a famous landmark (such as Taiwan's famous Raohe Night Market). You are able to interact with street vendors, customers, etc. 
This will be a building block for learning Chinese and useful phrases and slang that are needed to navigate the country.
