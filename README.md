# Hangul Immersive

This is an ongoing project focusing on language immersion through gaming. 
Using Unity and Blender3d, we're able to build an environment that language learners are able to explore and learn vocabulary naturally through.

Targets formality levels, slang, and general daily conversation that can be done in Korean. Ideally, minigames and mini quests pressure the player into understanding vocabulary when in an environment that they'll have to interact with another human in. 
**As of Dec. 2023, the game will only function with around 1,000 words, to tackle beginner Korean learners and for beginner review of basic grammar; using frequency lists and TOPIK 1 vocabulary lists
